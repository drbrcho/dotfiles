# Dotfiles

This is my `dotfiles` configuration.

## Breakdown

### Aliases

Basic aliases for common `CLI` tools as well as, `podman`, `nvim`, `git` and `kubectl`.

### Other functions

the last `25000` commands will be save in a `.histfile` in the `~/` (home directory)

## Setup Notes

Clone and move the `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` and `.tmux.conf` files to your `~/` (home)directory.

### OS Support

The configuration has been tested on both `Linux` and `macOS`.
